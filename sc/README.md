**Name**: DEV, QAT, UAT, PROD new environment construction

**Responsibilities**: Collaborate with other teams

**Challenge**: From zero to something

The implementation system architecture uses spring cloud as the microservice system

nginx as the reverse proxy

fastdfs as the high-performance distributed file system

Redis as the in-memory key-value database

kafka as the message queue

grafana as the system monitoring

and use Storm does data statistics

uses Mysql & Mongodb as the data persistence layer

uses telegram for alarms

uses docker service containerization

Nacos serves as the service registration center and configuration center

and Sentine-dashboard does health management and monitoring. And construct the 

communication and data exchange model between systems in the line transfer mode.

**Project goals**:

- Standardize Git development workflow (GitLab CI) and combine Jenkins Pipeline with workflow to build CI/CD
- Automatically deploy required services (mongo, mysql, jdk, nginx...) with Ansible
- Modular FTP combines the development process with CI/CD and introduces DEVOPS spiritual applications.


**Achievements**: Product environment operations
